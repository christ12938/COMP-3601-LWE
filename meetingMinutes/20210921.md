## Notes

- 16 bit architecture?
  - 16 bit architecture not enough, will need at least 32 bits because `(16 bit number) * (16 bit number) + (5 bit error)` could actually be bigger than 32 bits
- ISA brainstorming

    ```asm
    RAND    $RD, IMM        # random int from 0 (inclusive) to IMM (exclusive)
    RANDN   $RD             # random int normal

    MOD     $RD, $RS, $RT   # RD = RS % RT

    ADD     $RD, $RS, $RT
    SUB     $RD, $RS, $RT
    MUL     $RD, $RS, $RT
    DIV     $RD, $RS, $RT   # integer div

- Maybe instead of an ASIP like 3211, we just have 3 (or more) individual components working independently
  - Seems very difficult to have everything working on the same architecture, especially with very large matricies
  - Can easily switch components out without changing lots of things
  - Avoid complexity regarding pipeline hazards
  - Easier task allocation too
  - Will have to think about handshake protocol between components
  - There will probably be components in common across the 3 big components (multiplier, random number generator etc.)

## Questions for Tomorrow

- Storing the matricies and large numbers??
- ASIP vs independent components for each stage
- Is the size of the keys an parameter (before compilation)
- Marking criteria??
